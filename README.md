# Bankruptcy Prediction in Poland

This project focuses on predicting bankruptcy in the context of businesses in Poland. The primary goal is to develop a classification model to determine whether a company is likely to go bankrupt or not. The project involves the following key components:

## Project Description
- **Navigating the File System:** The project involves using command-line tools to navigate the file system for data retrieval and management.

- **Loading and Saving Files using Python:** Python is utilized to handle data, loading datasets, preprocessing, and saving model outputs.

- **Working with Imbalanced Data:** Dealing with imbalanced datasets is a crucial aspect of this project. Techniques such as resampling are employed to address this issue and ensure model performance is not skewed.

- **Building Ensemble Models:** The project utilizes ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Trees to improve the accuracy of bankruptcy predictions. Ensemble models are known for their robustness and effectiveness in handling complex classification tasks.

- **Model Evaluation:** To assess the performance of the classification models, evaluation metrics like precision and recall are used. These metrics help in understanding how well the model identifies companies at risk of bankruptcy and minimizes false positives.
